Curious Programmer, Speaker, Runner and a failed Comedian.
Call me a Web Addict! A curious knowledge-seeker with an
appetite to master in-depth wow technologies. I want to apply all
of these. Yes, I want to be the Einstein of every single thing. Wait a
second, I don't want to spend all of my life only in digging up stuff, I
will create a lot of things (I don't know yet...) to change the world.
Professionally, I ate a young Software Development Engineer, a
web developer at Nielsen. That's not the only way you should look
at me. I ate a performer, a community person who like to rneet
people, take initiative, overcome challenges, organize programs
and perform as a singer and standup comedian.
